Heavy construction vehicles routinely slam tailgates, reverse over and over again blasting their reversing alarms, and dump and spread gravel all hours of the night, all week long in this lot. I started this post this morning, Friday 10/27/17 at 1:30 a.m., while there were two dump trucks idling in the yard, that just finished repeatedly slamming their tailgates. 

This is seriously effecting my sleep and ability to work and study, and I know I am not alone, the yard is in the middle of our neighborhood and my neighbors are all experiencing the same. I will continue to elevate this issue as I have been given the runaround from the city code and permit office. It's obvious the bottom line for the project does not involve social responsibility.

There are ways to mitigate nuisance noise from the project/yard. First, trucks delivering construction materials can be required to do so during normal hours exempt from city noise requirements (7:00 a.m. - 8:30 p.m. per Raleigh City Code Sec. 12-5007(g)) - this is not difficult to achieve and should have no bearing on project progress (materials required for the night's work are delivered before hand, not during nighttime work, excavated materials/waste can be accumulated in a large truck/trailer for delivery in the morning, significantly reducing heavy vehicle traffic during late night/early morning hours, and eliminating slamming tailgates during these times). Secondly, loud and obnoxious traditional style reversing alarms can be replaced very inexpensively (less than $120 each) on city owned equipment that will be operated during off-hours, with advanced alarms purposefully designed for these situations. Contractor requirements can be easily altered/enforced as well.

I am reporting a collapsed spillway where Peace St./Clark Ave. pass over a creek that flows into Edna Metz Wells Park (https://www.raleighnc.gov/home/content/ParksRec/Articles/Parks/EdnaMetzWells.html). I’m guessing this collapse happened Monday evening during very heavy rains. The creek is now dropping straight down after exiting the pipe under the street; digging a deeper and deeper hole. There is also a cracked wall to the side of the creek. I think this location on Peace St./Clark Ave. is now compromised, and will become unstable.

I have attached a photo from my walk through the park today.

While this situation is most pressing, there is also another issue in the park due to storm-water run-off from the street. There is a poorly designed sidewalk improvement to provide handicap access (a great goal), that is now allowing water to leave the street and flow down a path into the park. The gouged section of the path is over a foot deep and growing; I’m guessing the gouged-out section is 20 feet long. This situation predates yesterday; it’s been going on ever since the sidewalk was reconfigured.

Please let me know that you have received this message.

In the past, the driver would stop his truck, pick up the trash bin, empty it, then put it back down in the same spot.

In more recent times, the driver picks up the bin, then resumes moving while emptying and releasing it, resulting in the bin's bouncing along the side of the road and ending up on its side (usually 10-12 feet from where it started). I predict that this is going to result, over time, in a significant decrease in the usable lifespan of the trash bins, along with a consequent increase in expenses to the city.

Please note that I'm not blaming the driver--I strongly suspect that this is an unintended result of some management policy that was introduced that is giving our route driver the incentive to try and complete his route as quickly as possible.

A left turn lane which turns into the apartment complex was added on Cary Towne Blvd heading towards Raleigh/Western Blvd as part of this apartment complex being built.  I've lost count of the number of times I've seen vehicles blow right through this left turn without stopping at all, some not even slowing down.  I'm guessing they aren't noticing the stop sign way over to the right, and don't realize it's a 4-way stop.  The stop sign could probably be difficult to see when vehicles are in the straight through lane, but I've seen this happen with no vehicles in the straight through lane or anything else blocking the view of the stop sign from that left turn lane.  I've almost been hit two times in the last two weeks because of vehicles in this left turn lane not stopping, after I've come to a complete stop on Farm Gate Rd and then continue on with my left turn onto Cary Towne thinking they're going to stop - and then the person on Cary Towne making the left turn fusses at me when they're in the wrong for not stopping. The most recent incident was this past Monday, April 3. I was making a left onto Cary Towne and stopped on Farm Gate. A semi truck was approaching in the left turn lane into the apartment complex, I thought he was stopping so made my left turn, and he almost hit me because he wasn't planning on stopping for the 4-way stop like he was supposed to.  That latest incident was witnessed by a co-worker of mine who happened to be behind me in her car.  Something really needs to be done about this intersection before a wreck happens (if one hasn't happened already).

Adding a short bike rout connecting Umstead to existing airport roads would make a great path for riders and commuters between Raleigh and Briar Creek (and some parts of RTP as well!). 

With the current greenway connections, the only way for a biker to get from this end of Umstead to Briar Creek is to ride south to 54 and then west and back up to Page Road to cross under the freeway - lots of extra mileage and annoyed drivers on that route. 

Recent news coverage of the RDU airport authority planning process makes them appear very anti-bicycle. Adding to the greenway paths to allow transit across the airport would be a good idea to repair their image with Triangle bicyclists.

Below is the original post-

In a Raleigh-initiative, the city planted 2 trees on our property/city property a couple years back. One flourished while the other got sick. Our HOA complained and we had to cut down the tree which only got to 7 feet high at it's tallest point. We are left with a 5"" diameter stump between the sidewalk and the street which is city property. I had e-mailed the city but never got a response. The HOA wants the stump removed and we do not have the financial resources to do so especially for something that the city should be taking care of. Can someone please remove the stump?",Acknowledged,Other,https://seeclickfix.com/files/issue_images/0051/0438/IMG_4451_1_.JPG,15012,Other

This is great as there have been many instances of unnecessary traffic being created as a result of that turn being allowed.  However, the sign was put a couple car lengths before the actual intersection so that you can't actually see the sign if you've stopped to turn.

In two separate instances within a day of one another, I've seen drivers attempt and turn left even though the turn is not legal.  It may be that this sign is just too new and people haven't noticed it yet but it's also not placed in the most visible/convenient location either. The sign is at least a car length, if not more, before the intersection and on the right side of the west bound wade avenue.

A sign like this really needs to be placed closer to the intersection, possibly even on the left side. Being placed at the median would be much more ideal but the road is already fairly narrow already and no concrete median exists at that part of Wade Avenue.",Acknowledged,"""No left turn"" sign is not near the actual intersection",,7342,Traffic Visual Obstruction

Cars do not know where to stop (for westbound traffic on Western some go through the intersection and stop by the walkway others stop before the intersection, eastbound cars on Western turning left onto Boylan do not always stop before the crosswalk but seek to turn while the cars are stopped on Western). All of this is very hazardous for pedestrians and motorists. Is there some kind of signage to alert those turning onto Western from Boylan that they should be alert to the possibility of a red light at the crosswalk? Should the crosswalk be moved? Is there a sign to inform turning traffic from Western onto Boylan about where to stop or can an additional light be placed over the turn lane?

Millbrook, there is an exit from Timbers Apartments on the left.  Residents frequently do these two things during heavy 5 PM traffic and there are frequent accidents and near misses at the Millbrook x Timber Creek intersection because of it.

1) They get in the eastbound right turn lane (marked with a yellow star in the picture) going the wrong way and trying to turn left into Timbers.  By the way, during rush hour, this lane is almost always backed up past the entrance to the Timbers, so it creates a standstill.
2) They come to a full stop in the westbound lane (blue star in the picture), waiting for the eastbound turn lane to clear so they can turn into Timbers.  They come to a full and unexpected stop during rush hour on a 45 mph road.  It's no wonder there are wrecks.

I am also attempting to contact Timbers management to get them to communicate regarding this issue to their residents, but in the meantime, I believe DOT or police should evaluate.  Whether there needs to be additional painting in the eastbound turn lane that makes it clear it's not a left-into-Timbers lane, or a sign, or additional police monitoring during rush hour, I'm not sure.  But the problem occurs there daily.  An officer in an unmarked car could sit there from 5:15 until 5:45 and probably witness a fender bender, several near misses, and a lot of flustered honking and confusion.

I really can't see how this apartment complex was not required to provide an additional entrance or notify their residents to U turn and take a right into the complex instead of causing traffic jams and wrecks.

They don't seem to have a green arrow for long enough at the beginning of the cycle to clear the turn lane. As a result, they start to back up into the through lanes, causing traffic to back up for a good distance.  When the turn lane backs into the through Lane, there are usually only two or three vehicles. So an adjustment of a few seconds on the green arrow might be all we need to help move this along.

This block is a one way street. Cars park all up and down both sides for the street. The people that park on the street are both residents of the block, and visitors to the popular area and of the church. When cars are parked on both sides of the road (all the time), it turns into a single lane road. The problem is that cars FLY down this street and there is no room to swerve or avoid anything that may step out into the road or car doors opening. 

Cars fly down this road and if a child or animal were to step out from between parked cars, it would be a tragic and potentially fatal accident. What is worse is even if the driver did see someone stepping out into the road and swerved to miss them, there is nowhere to go to avoid hitting them. Many people walk down this street to get to the 5 points area and all of the restaurants and shops so there is heavy foot traffic.

Cars have clipped my car taking off the side mirror, and you have to take your own life in your hands when getting out of the car that a speeding car does not take off your door. 

This is a narrow street that is occupied by many families with small children and pets. 

It is my understanding that the street was made one way on this block to reduce through traffic but many if not most people using this road do not live on it. This is a straight and down hill street which already makes it easy to gain speed, but people fly going well over 40 MPH and it is dangerous in such a narrow space. Someone is going to get seriously hurt.
